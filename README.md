# my-first-website-
This was my first coding project, part of a first-year unviersity assignment to create a website for a fictional client that wanted a website for  'Cantor College.' The site was relatively basic, refelecting my intial learning stage of coding concepts. I used 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript for this project. Additioally, I experiemented with PHP to connect to a backend database, but that attempt was unfourtuantely unsuccessful. 

## Goal
The websited was designed as a resource for prospective students and to promote Cantor College. It aimed to provide detailed information about differnt aspects of the college. 

## Improvements
- Mobile-friendly
- Connecting back-end database 

## How To Run
1. Clone the repository (e.g., in Visual Studio Code) and save it in your desired location
2. You must have the live server extension installed within your visual studio code. You can open this website in a browser with live server
