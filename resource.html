            <h1>Rules Governing the Use of the Resource Services</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> 
                All students and staff of the College are entitled to register as members of the Learning Resources and to use the 
                facilities of the Learning Resources for the purpose of their course of study or College employment. <br> Membership 
                may also be extended to other individuals and to persons nominated from other organisations:  a fee is usually charged.  
                Access to the Learning Resources for study purposes may be made available to non-members by arrangement. Details are 
                available in the External Services leaflet.<br><br>Use of Learning Resources facilities implies acceptance of the Learning 
                Resources rules printed below.  These are designed to protect the interests of all users of Learning Resources and to 
                ensure that the College operates within the law and can carry out its functions efficiently and effectively.  The 
                Learning Resources rules apply in principle to all Learning Resources sites, including workstation rooms and site 
                libraries, notwithstanding some variations in practice in the site libraries. Admission to the Learning Resources is 
                conditional upon observation of the rules and the staff of the Learning Resources are empowered to enforce them. <br><br> Breaches
                 of the rules may be dealt with by specific Learning Resources Disciplinary Action (see below), including the withdrawal of 
                 some or all Learning Resources facilities, and if appropriate by invoking the College's Regulations for Students, in the 
                 case of students, or in the case of staff through the appropriate College procedures as set out in the Staff Handbook. 
                </p>
